# KSS on Computational Physics

Welcome to the Computational Physics KSS organised by Amateur Astronomy Club, NITK!

The aim of this KSS is to provide a platform for students to learn about the fundamentals of Computational Physics and motivate them to apply these in various fields of interdisciplinary sciences.

For Jupyter Notebook installation guide follow this [link](/Installation.md).

## Resources for Self Study:

These resources are by no means exhaustive and are usually much more technical than what is required for an introduction to the subject. </br>
However, if you wish to learn more about the subject, these are a great place to start.

Happy Learning!
